Make sure you have GIT installed and you can run it from command line. Try out the GIT GUI applications that may make your life a little bit easier. If you are using Visual Studio Code you can work with git directly from the IDE.





1. Create account on GitHub (http://github.com)

2. Use the invitation link, link Git Classroom (each assignment has its own link)

3. Accept the assignment

4. GIT classroom will create a repository with some code in it. The code exemplifies, how to use input files and parameters. Make sure you explore it and can run it.

5. When you think you are done, push your code to the repository.
..

6. For subsequent assignments will have to reuse your own code. I suggest you fork your previous assignment and point the remote to the current assignment repository. See here how it is done: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15775183/git-different-remote-for-each-branch

Alternatively, you can just manually copy all the files
